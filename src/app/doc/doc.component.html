      What is this?
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is a product of my undergraduate final year project. It is a facial expression modifier that takes a face
      image and generates images with seven facial expressions while (hopefully :p) keeping the identity of the input
      subject unchanged. The algorithm behind is based on a novel deep learning method called Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

      Give it a try and see for yourself! (Click on the guy with glasses)

      If you want to know more about the project, please have a look of the report above and the screencast below.
      Or if you want to build it yourself and improve it, don’t forget to check out the GitHub page, which provides
      various implementations of GANs as well as some image preprocessing scripts. Don’t hesitate to
